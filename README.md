Final-Exam-Grade-Calculator
===========================
After entering the grades you earned in other areas of the class as well as their associated weighted percentages, 
the program prompts the user with one of two options. The user can either enter a grade they expect to earn on their
final and check to see what their class grade would be or the user can enter the grade they would like to earn in the
class and then check to see what grade they'd then need to achieve on their final exam.
